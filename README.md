This repository can be found at https://github.com/OlaedoOkpareke/FinalPaperRepository.

First run the simulation file, this creates an imitation dataset that is similar to the one that will be used for analysis. Then rscript file, this cleans the dataset and loads the clean dataset into the Inputs Folder. Then look at the datasheet pdf to *what is the use of datasheets?* Then run the bib file for references and citations, then run the rmd file.  

The repository is organised as follows:

1. The Outputs folder: 

The .bib file contains the citations for the raw data, website that the data is gotten from, packages and literature used in the report.

The rmd file contains the analysis report on the decision to seek mental health care globally for 2021 based on status in different grouos, as well as the code used to create the report. This code was mainly used to create tables and graphs, as well as for training and testing.

The pdf file contains the same analysis report but in pdf form, and without the code.

2. The Inputs folder:

The wgm_full_wave2_public_file_final (1)_csv.csv dataset is the original dataset gotten from the data source.
The datamod csv file contains the cleaned and modifed dataset; main dataset used in the report. 
The Rmd file is the datasheet for the original dataset, and to an extent the cleaned dataset. It includes *what is the datasheet for*

3. The Scripts folder:

The r script contains the code for reading in the data, cleaning and modifying the variables, and saving the csv file. 

The simulation file contains the code used to create an imitation dataset using false data that looks similar to the actual dataset, used for analysis?
